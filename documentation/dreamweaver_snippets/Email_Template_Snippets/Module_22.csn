      <p style="margin: 0;"> A lot of people are lying to you about AV-over-IP. It's not easy. It's not lossless compression. And it's not going to happen overnight. But it IS the future of AV signal distribution. There is currently NO adopted standard for sending AV signals (video, audio, control and power) over the network — there are multiple ways of doing it, and none of the options are interoperable. So, buyer and adopter, beware. This webinar will take you on a journey through the plethora of signal routing options via an IP network and explain how each one works. We'll talk what's good about each, what's bad about each and, most of all, how likely it is that AV-over-IP experiences industry-wide adoption. AV-over-IP affects not only the future of signal routing but also control. So this means everything you design for will change — meeting rooms, classrooms, boardrooms, churches, digital signage networks, museums, auditoriums, live events. Everything. Don't switch your company over to AV-over-IP without attending this webinar from rAVe's founder, Gary Kayye. You will leave understanding every option out there — including what works and what's pure hype — and how to evaluate the trade-offs for each. Sponsored by Barco, this webinar is approved for 1.5 CTS, CTS-I and CTS-D RUs.
