What is the new email template? 
	⁃	The new template is a modular set of code that allows you to create unique emails every time that falls within the same design system. 
	⁃	There are two parts to this set of code the frame which is where you input what modules you want, and the modules which are where the separate segments are that can be copies into the frame and updated with the proper links, images, and body copy.

How To Use The Frames And Modules
	⁃	Each email should be saved within a dated folder. For example jun27. Within this folder should be an assets folder. 

Using Snippets
	⁃	To use a snippet in Dreamweaver you must install the snippets in your library. To navigate to the location where you need to install your snippets click on the main drive of your computer (Macintosh HD) then press CMD + SHIFT + . to show hidden files. Then follow the file path of Users/accountname/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CC 2019/en_US/Configuration/Snippets/ then drop the folder here. Choose your frame and type in its name frame1email, frame2email, or frame3email then press tab.

	⁃	To use a snippet in Atom you must first install them. To install snippets open Atom and on the Atom tab at the top left chose snippets. Open the supplied file and copy and paste all of the contents into the snippets.cson file and save. Choose your frame and type in its name frame1email, frame2email, or frame3email then press enter or tab.

Using Copy and Pasted Code
	⁃	Open the file frame of choice frame_template_(1, 2, or 3).html in a code editor of choice (Dreamweaver, Atom, etc.). Then save a copy of the frame_template.html named as index.html to your dated folder.

	⁃	In the frame, start by updating the <title>Update This Title.</title> section (line 4) and the <!-- HIDDEN PREHEADER TEXT --> section (line 180). These two sections should have the same content within them. The Preheader text is for the emails and the title section shows up for the web version of the email.

	⁃	After those sections are updated move down to the header. Within the <h1>Email Temp Frame.</h1> section (line 221) replace the current text with the new header. Make your header short and succinct as it will grab attention better and the header looks best when kept to a few words or one line of text on the email. 

	⁃	Next move down to the footer of the page and find the Unsubscribe and View Online sub-section (line 302). You will need to update the link for the “View Online” sub-section. Move to the <a href=“http://almoproav.net/campaigns/”> tag and type in the location of the html file which will need to be uploaded to the file server upon completion. 
	⁃	For example: http://almoproav.net/campaigns/zoomrm/jun27/index.html

	⁃	Compile all of the assets you will be using and save them in your assets folder. Upload this folder to the file server within your dated folder. Ex: http://almoproav.net/campaigns/zoomrm/june27/assets/image1.jpg This location is where you should link all images, gifs, etc. You do this so when you send your email out they will show up everywhere not just on your local computer. 

	⁃	Make sure all of your assets are sized properly. All hero images should be 600 x 300. All two column images should be 260 x 180. All three column images should be 170 x 110. All four column image should be 120 x 75.

	⁃	Now to the good stuff. Open the file module_list.pdf. Go through the pdf file and choose the modules you want to use within your email and make a list of them.

Using Snippets 
	⁃	In Dreamweaver you can either click on the snippet in the snippets window or type out the name of your module (module1email) and press tab. 

	⁃	To use your snippets type the name of the module snippet you want to use (frame1email), between the <!-- Insert Modular Content Here —>, and press tab or enter.

Using Copy and Pasted Code 
	⁃	Go to your modules.html file. Copy and paste the modules you want to use within the <!-- Insert Modular Content Here --> (244) comment on the email_template_frame.html in the order you want them to appear. Make sure to not use Module 10 and 11 in this area. Place these module 10 and 11 after the comment <!-- END CONTENT BLOCK --> and before the footer. 

	⁃	Save your file a final time and open it in a web browser of your choice. Read over the complete document for spelling errors, visual errors, and click every link that you changed. You don’t want your email to get sent out linking to the wrong products, images, or pages.

	⁃	Upload finished file to respective location ex: /campaigns/zoomrm/jun27/index.html along with a text only version saved as a .txt file.

	⁃	Upload to Pardot to schedule email sending.
